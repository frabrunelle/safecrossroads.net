The SAFE Network is a project of such large scope, doing things that have never been done, it can be hard to wrap one's head around the whole thing without a lot of work. But in the end it is for people to use. It needs to be easily adopted and made to work by everyone.

As core development progresses rapidly towards beta launch, tracking the evolution of the user experience (UX) development can help everyone understand the potentialities for this vast project from a practical, people-empowering perspective.

To help us with that we talk to Jim Collinson, a UX Designer at MaidSafe. He walks us through some of the approaches and priorities of UX design in general, and shares insights about the process of evolving UX in parallel to the core team putting final form to the networks basic functionality.
