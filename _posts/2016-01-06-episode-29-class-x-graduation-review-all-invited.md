#### In this Episode

Come one, come all, to the last planned class of the SAFE Network School.

We do a high-level overview of what we know about the SAFE Network in a way that even parents, friends and family of the proud graduates will be warmed with what they learn, and be proud of those who have worked so hard to get closer to the bare metal of this elegant technology.

Graduates will be reminded of all that they have learned by noting the intricate details that have been artfully avoided in this presentation for broad consumption. This is your graduation test, students.

This is not just rah-rah, either. We take up a few important points which didn't get proper attention in the class series proper, but should be of interest to everyone.

Thanks to all for attending.
