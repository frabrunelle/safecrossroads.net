SAFE Crossroads is probably the first podcast and blog feed dedicated exclusively to the SAFE Network, its technology, ideas, applications, people and news. Whether you are new to the SAFE Network community or not, we hope you'll enjoy our first podcast,  "What is the SAFE Network, anyway?" It's meant to help get everyone on the same page.
