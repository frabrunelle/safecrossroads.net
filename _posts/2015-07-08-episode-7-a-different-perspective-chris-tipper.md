In March of this year, an unexpected type of [post](https://safenetforum.org/t/a-different-perspective/3232) appeared on the SAFE Network community forum. It was from a teacher with a very unique take on what is being undertaken in Project SAFE, and the effect it was having on a lot of students. This is a very refreshing look to the future, and a shining example of a teacher who knows how to make a difference.
