#### In this Episode

This week chronicles a mini adventure I had trying to connect with others in the south Texas area who might want to form a meet-up regarding the SAFE Network. It started with a post on the [SAFE Network Community Forum](https://safenetforum.org), on to connecting with and appearing on [The Crypto Show](http://www.thecryptoshow.com), and back to an interview with the Project SAFE member who suggested The Crypto Show connection, Rich Beer. All in all, it was an interesting adventure and I hope you'll enjoy some of the results. I haven't given up the quest to connect with others in my general area who are interested in and want to know more and perhaps get involved in Project SAFE. Only just started, in fact. The adventure continues!
