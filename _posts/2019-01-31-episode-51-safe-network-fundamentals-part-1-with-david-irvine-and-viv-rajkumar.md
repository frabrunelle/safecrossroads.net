I had the honor of a 2+ hour conversation with the two people most familiar with all aspects of the SAFE Network, MaidSAFE's Founder and CEO, David Irvine and CTO, Viv Rajkumar.

To guide our discussion we focused on the 21 Fundamentals of the SAFE Network as linked below. We had a very far-ranging discussion from high to medium altitude, touching on all aspects of the whats and whys that make this project so unique and far-reaching.
