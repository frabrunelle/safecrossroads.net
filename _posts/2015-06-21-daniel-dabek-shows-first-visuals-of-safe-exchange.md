Very apropos of the last post, this one deals with a very cool interview with Daniel on the LIFE IS PEOPLE google hangout [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9urwgbxfm-U).

Great discussion overall, but right at the beginning is a great demo of some of the visuals that Infinity Algorithms is cooking up for the SAFE Network environment.
