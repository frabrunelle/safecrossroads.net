It is a delight to have back two previous guests, Nikita Baksalyar and Lionel Faber, for a wide-ranging conversation that touches on many advances in SAFE Network development. Centering around the recently released Vault program library, we explore the implications of other advances, including new data types, how they relate to each other, safecoin integration, and a lot more.

The concept of the Perpetual Web--private, secure and free--takes on much greater clarity.

Enjoy.
