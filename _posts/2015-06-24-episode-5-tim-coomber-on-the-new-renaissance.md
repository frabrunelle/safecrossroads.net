We are delighted to present a recap of important aspects of the SAFE Network ecosystem and why they are important, followed by a great interview with Tim Coomber of Scotland, one of the hosts of the LIFE IS PEOPLE videocast on Google Hangouts/Youtube. We explore the subject of how the SAFE Network--through the application N99 (Network 99)--will allow content creators to be compensated by the network itself, whether consumers pay for their content or not! This is a game changer for creative people, especially artist, musicians, writers, gamers, news publishers, and many other types of people who create content that people find valuable.
