We're very happy to present an interview with Daniel Dabek, the Co-founder and CEO of Infinity Algorithms, the first company created specifically to exploit the SAFE Network commercially. We talk about Daniel's remarkable background and fully break down (simply) the first project of Infinity Algorithms, SafeX, the technology which will allow truly decentralized commerce with the launch of the SAFE Network.

This is exciting stuff, folks. Don't miss it!
