In this episode we catch up on some of the things that have been going on in SAFE Network development, where it's been and what's coming down the line now, including the roll out of public testing of the automated peer-to-peer connection library, Crust (standing for "Connected" "Rust").

How do you ensure all the nodes of an ever-morphing P2P network get and stay connected, even past firewalls and routers? How do you do it when most nodes are being run by non-technical people using their spare computer resources? 

The demands are high. Will Crust be up to the job?
