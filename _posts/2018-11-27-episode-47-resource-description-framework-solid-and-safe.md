Simpleton says, "We go a bit geeky on this one, but in a way that should be very accessible to most anyone."

Our guests on this episode are Josh Wilson and Gabriel Viganotti. Both are front-end developers for MaidSafe, working with Resource Description Framework (RDF) in a number of forms, to enhance the uses of the SAFE Network.

We really get down to what RDF is, how it relates to Linked Data and the Socially Linked Data (SOLID) project, and other use cases that are creating a real revolution in how we manage data, making it both more useful as well as returning control of users' data to users. 

Your host learned a lot. Hope you find it useful.
