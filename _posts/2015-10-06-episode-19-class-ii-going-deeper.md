#### In this Episode

Class II of the SAFE Network School takes us deeper. We probe down and start to pull apart the great intricacy of the SAFE Network by closely examining the key elements that make it work. But not too fast or overwhelmingly. You'll be surprised how understandable it is when guided by a Simpleton who has already done most of the brain-warping exploration, so that you don't have to warp YOUR head so much.

Come along as we start to peel apart the "secrets" of how the SAFE Network is designed and why it is so powerful. There are no secrets, actually. It just takes a little patience, perhaps some repetition. But it's worth it!

Since the SAFE Network is being built on a very different combination of fundamentals than has ever been used before and because it is so intricate, it's not possible to just wade in and get a full picture of it without some work. This is especially true because the network is still in development and so can't be used and learned by experience, either.

Your host and others have been expending a lot of effort behind the scenes to improve the documentation and make it more accessible to everyone. That project is very far from satisfactorily complete, but good progress has been made.

I am also aware that there are a lot of people like myself who have the time to listen, but not to sit down and study. Also a lot of people learn best be audio input.

As we go forward, these School podcasts will not stand alone very well. Understanding of later ones will depend on earlier information and insights. But that's okay. It's the only way to go deeper.

I also see this approach making listener participation much more inviting. I look forward to feedback, questions and other input, and will do my best to integrate everything into a great experience for all.
