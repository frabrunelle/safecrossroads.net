_**grok** [Martian]_ literally meaning "to drink" but taken to mean "to understand at a deep, intuitive level." (from the novel _Stranger in a Strange Land_, by Robert Heinlein, a story about a human raised by Martians)

Having explored the SAFE Network from end to end through our School series so far, in this Class we are finally ready let safecoin help spread our senses out through the SAFE Network as a whole. We can now begin to _grok_ SAFE in fullness.

Now can we embrace some key aspects of the network that we've not yet been able to fully appreciate. We clarify and break down the types of data on the SAFE Network and start of get a grip on what can be done with them. We follow the life cycle of a safecoin and define clearly what a safecoin actually IS.

We revisit part of an earlier interview with Benjamin Bollen, who helps us understand the handling of data types in network as a whole, and what the connection and routing software libraries make available to other distributed network developers.

And finally we hear (indirectly) from David Irvine about the developments discussed in this class and what they let developers start working with, to take the SAFE Network (and other projects it will surely spawn) up to and then beyond what the current internet allows--except decentralized, economical and truly secure from the start. Very stimulating stuff.

We've hacked through lots of details. Now let the big picture settle in.
