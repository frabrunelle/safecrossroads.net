Viv Rajkumar is CTO of MaidSafe in Troon, Scotland.

We go into depth about the development process in general, the development experience at MaidSafe, and then catch up on what's been going on with the forward motion of SAFE Network development.

There's quite a lot here, but very accessible.

One thing discussed is the new test net in which community members are back to testing vaults at home, as well as user side experiment. This test network went live between the time the interview was recorded and publication, so go to safenetforum.org and see if you can participate!
