As the various parts of SAFE Network development come together, facility for mobile access to and use of the network becomes a greater priority. Most individuals now use mobile devices for a large part, if not all, of their internet access. 

Our guest is Lionel Faber, a front-end developer with MaidSafe's remote office in Chennai, India.

We talk about mobile development for SAFE in general and the new developer tools for native Android apps in particular. The SAFE Network offers something unique: the opportunity to make truly decentralized apps that interact directly with the network rather than requiring for servers to be maintained.
