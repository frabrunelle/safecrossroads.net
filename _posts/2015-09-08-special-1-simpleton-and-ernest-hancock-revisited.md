This is the first in a series special edition SAFE Crossroads podcasts. Specials will contain content not formally part of the main series which play on the Let's Talk Bitcoin Network, but which may yet be of interest to SAFE Crossroads followers.

#### In this episode

Your host recently had the opportunity to appear live on Declare Your Independence with Ernest Hancock. The interview is presented here, lightly edited, pretty much as you'd have heard it live on the air.

Hope you find it interesting and useful.
