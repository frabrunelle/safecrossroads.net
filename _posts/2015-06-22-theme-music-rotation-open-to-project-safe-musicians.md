title: Theme Music Rotation, Open to Project SAFE Musicians
category: News
---

The SAFE Crossroads Podcast is now accepting submissions for intro/outro and bridge music for use on a rotating basis on the podcast. If used, the artist(s) will receive attribution both verbally on the podcast and in all show notes.

Additionally, proportional to the use, when music is used on a podcast, the artist will receive a percentage of the LTBcoin distribution awarded by the LTB network for that episode!

Thanks to Nick Koteskey (on the SAFE Network forum as @Nigel) for being the ground breaker on this. His efforts are much appreciated.
