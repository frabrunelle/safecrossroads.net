We're happy to announce the opening of the Simpleton's School of the SAFE Network.

Since the SAFE Network is being built on a very different combination of fundamentals than has ever been used before and because it is so intricate, it's not possible to just wade in and get a full picture of it without some work. This is especially true because the network is still in development and so can't be used and learned by experience, either.

Therefore, the effort of this podcast up to this point has been to share and create interest in the SAFE Network, hopefully enough to inspire folks to take the time to dig in and study the subject more closely. That's been a fine approach, as far as it goes. Looking at various functions and news, and exploring the people of the network has been valuable, but after a while it's not enough.

Your host and others have been expending a lot of effort behind the scenes to improve the documentation and make it more accessible to everyone. That project is very far from satisfactorily complete, but good progress has been made.

I am also aware that there are a lot of people like myself who have the time to listen, but not to sit down and study. Also a lot of people learn best be audio input.

So here is what we are going to do: The SAFE Crossroads Podcast hereby opens its own SAFE Network School. We'll see where all it goes but, to start, the SAFE Network Wiki is a great basic overview of the network, with a lot of detail that will help. The other facility is the Simpleton himself, who is not a geek but has spent many, many hours interfacing data about the network directly, on the SAFE Network community forum, etc., and has accumulated insights which others should find useful.

Your host will be reading the wiki aloud, stopping to comment, cross-reference, look up glossary and other definitions, and generally working through the basics of the SAFE Network making them as accessible as possible. You'll get to see where the Simpleton has outstanding question, too, because I'll be open as we explore this together.

As we go forward, these School podcasts will not stand alone very well. Understanding of later ones will depend on earlier information and insights. But that's okay. It's the only way to go deeper.

I also see this approach making listener participation much more inviting. I look forward to feedback, questions and other input, and will do my best to integrate everything into a great experience for all.

We'll still be doing other types of podcasts as appropriate. But if you see the distinctive SAFE Network School logo, you'll know you're back in class.

So, let's see how this goes!
